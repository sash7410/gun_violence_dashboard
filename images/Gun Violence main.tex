\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing gun violence data in the U.S. Key research questions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geographic Patterns}: What are the geographic and temporal patterns in gun violence across the United States?
    \item \textbf{Incident Type Comparison}: How do different types of gun violence incidents vary by state and over time?
    \item \textbf{Regional Analysis}: Which states or regions show higher frequencies of specific incident types, and do these patterns change over time?
\end{itemize}

Each aspect of the dashboard's design directly supports investigating these questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geographic view enables spatial pattern analysis
    \item Time-based filtering supports temporal trend identification
    \item Multiple visualization types allow cross-comparison of incident types
\end{itemize}
Answering these questions can support policymakers and researchers in identifying areas with high violence rates and understanding underlying patterns.

\section{Dataset Description and Preparation}
The Gun Violence Analysis Dashboard uses four distinct datasets to comprehensively represent different facets of gun violence across the United States. Each dataset is categorized by incident type (mass shootings, gun deaths, police incidents) and is supplemented with attributes such as location (state) and time (year). The datasets used are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mass Shootings Dataset}: This dataset includes records of mass shooting incidents across different years and locations in the U.S. Each record provides details about the incident location, the number of victims, and the date. This data helps identify patterns and clusters in mass shooting incidents.
    
    \item \textbf{Gun Deaths Dataset}: The gun deaths dataset contains information on fatalities due to gun violence, categorized by location and time. This dataset allows for an analysis of geographic and temporal patterns in gun-related deaths, highlighting areas with higher mortality rates.

    \item \textbf{Police Incidents Dataset}: This dataset includes records of incidents involving police, where firearms were used. Each record specifies the location and count of incidents, offering insights into the frequency of police-related shootings in different regions.

    \item \textbf{Aggregated Yearly Data by State}: This dataset aggregates incident counts by year and by state, enabling a broader analysis of trends over time across different regions. It supports both high-level yearly trends for all states and detailed views for individual states, allowing users to compare gun violence patterns by year and across locations.

\end{itemize}

Data preprocessing involved several steps to ensure consistency and compatibility for dashboard visualization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Cleaning}: Each dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies in location naming, and variations in date formats. This ensured that the data was uniform across all records and ready for analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Aggregation}: For the aggregated yearly dataset, incident counts were summed by state and by year. This aggregation was essential for generating annual trend analyses and supporting the Yearly Dashboard views.

    \item \textbf{Data Transformation for Compatibility}: The datasets were transformed into a format compatible with the Dash framework. This included converting certain attributes to categorical types for optimized filtering, and ensuring date and location fields were in a standardized format to enable dynamic interaction across the dashboard.
\end{itemize}

By using these four datasets, the dashboard provides a multi-dimensional perspective on gun violence in the U.S., offering users the ability to filter and explore data by incident type, year, and state. This structured approach enables comprehensive trend analysis and supports detailed insights into specific types of gun violence.
